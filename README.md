Exercise 2.1 Program Structure
==============================

In this repository, you will find the files you need to build a very simple, and for the purpose of arithmetic operations somewhat superfluous file structure. But they go to explain the concept of how to divide a C program into logical file structures.

Have a look at all the files and specially the main.c file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include "subtraction.h"
#include "multiplication.h"

int main (void) {
  int a = 10;
  int b = -2;

  printf ("\nHere, we add, subtract and multiply....\n\n");
  printf ("%d\t+\t%d\t=\t%d\n", a, b, cal_add(a,b));
  printf ("%d\t-\t%d\t=\t%d\n", a, b, cal_subtract(a,b));
  printf ("%d\t*\t%d\t=\t%d\n", a, b, cal_multiply(a,b));

  return 0;
}

```

Fist setup your compilers Warning level to `/Wall`. Right click on your project in the solution explorer, go to options, and change the warning level as shown here:

1. Compile the program structure, and explain the errors you get.

1. In the files, various declarations, definitions and includes are missing â€“ fix the errors that you can find until you can compile the entire program and when running it get the following output:
